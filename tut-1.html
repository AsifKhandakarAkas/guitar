        <h1>Learn how to hold your guitar.</h1>
        <p>Finally you are starting your guitar journey. Sounds great!!!</p>
        <p>Wish you all the best for your rest or the journey with guitar. Hope you are with a decent guitar with you. If not then I have a suggestion for you, you can check it now on below link. </p>
        <p>Okay, let's jump on our topic. You may think that holding a guitar is a easiest thing, so why this lesson? You're right it's simple but you may suffer a lot if you hold your guitar in a wrong way.</p>

        <h3>Step-By-Step: Holding your guitar in casual way</h3>
        <p>I'm going to demonastrate the process from a right-hander's perspective. If you are lefty then do the opposite. Steps are: </p>
        <h4 class="text-danger">Step-1: Set your guitar on your right leg. </h4>
        <p>Sit on a chair and put your guitar on your right leg. If you can then use a footstool. The footstool elevates your right leg and bring the guitar in a more suitable and comfortable position. It allows you to play guitar for longer period with less discomfort. Get a footstool on amazon.</p>
        <h4 class="text-danger">Step-2: Stable your guitar with right arm.</h4>
        <p>Now you have to Stable your guitar position so that the guitar position isn't going to off-position when you are playing your guitar. You have to use your right arm on top of your guitar and rest your hand on the front of the guitar.</p>
        <strong>Don't try to put the whole weight of your arm, just be easy and be comfortable.</strong>

        <h4 class="text-danger">Step-3: Bring your fretting hand closer to your body.</h4>
        <p>You shouldn't use your left and to stable your guitar because it will be use to change chord over the fret indipendently.</p>
        <strong>Bring your left arm closer to your body thus you will have more control over the fret.</strong>
        <h4 class="text-danger">Step-4: Don't slouch the guitar in towards your.</h4>
        <p>Many beginner do this mistake while playing guitar for the first time that is slouching the guitar in towards them. Thus they want to see the fret while playing guitar. Strongly recommended not to do this. Because this is bad for your posture and also practice time. So don't do this, make your posture right and practice in a good way. </p>

        <img src="classical.jpg" alt="" class="w-50 d-block mx-auto">
        <h1>Classical mathod to hold your guitar.</h1>
        <p>Place your guitar on your left leg, if you are right handed and if not then do the opposite. The footstool is recommended this time also. By keeping the guitar on your left legt the guitar neck moves further to the left and elevates it more. That means you can easily reach all notes of the fretboard.</p>
        <strong>The classical method is not suitable for all Especially when you are a beginner i recommend you to follow casual method. Because this classical method is little bit harder and not suitable for long time practice.</strong>

        <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">
<img src="standing.jpg" class="w-50 d-block mx-auto" alt="">
        <h1>Standing position</h1>
        <p>This time you have to buy a decent strap from store. You can buy it from amazon.</p>
        <p>You need strap because it's impossible to play guitar perfectly in standing position without strap. Strap helps to maintain the stability and allows you to focus on strumming. So attach a strap and practice in standing position.
