        <h1>Few finger excercises</h1>
        <p>I think you know about finger, fret and strings. If not then follow my previous tutorial. I will discuss simple steps in this lecture as I assume you are an absolute beginner. If you’re following me from the beginning then this tutorial is going to be very special for you. Because to be honest from today you are going to be start your actual journey with guitar. Okay let’s jump on today’s topic. </p>
        <p>At first you have to understand what is finger exercise and why should you do this. Okay don’t think too much, I have answer for you. You see the strings of your guitar are nothing but few metal wires. So it is normal to got hurt when you are pressing these strings. Because your finger tip receives extreme number of nerves and that produces pain when you press the strings. And one thing is that you are going to press the strings against tension repeatedly and almost by the same point of your finger tip. Again you have to press different strings in different position. So you have to practice more and more to improve your skill and you have to keep in mind that you have to be a good guitarist. Okay, I have some suggestion before discuss various exercises about what to do and what not to do.</p>
        <h4>What to do-</h4>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>•	Always press strings with finger in 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li>•	Try to touch single or just desired strings.</li>
            <li>•	Do practice with metronome.</li>
            <li>•	Warm up your whole body when exercise.</li>
            <li>•	Stretch your fingers for few minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What not to do-</h4>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>•	Don’t touch any other strings when playing. Because that will mute those strings.</li>
            <li>•	Don’t try to exercise without metronome and without attention. Because your performance standard depends on your exercise quality.</li>
            <li>•	Don’t exercise for longer period at a time. Rather take some break and start again.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">
        <h4>Exercise 1: Pattern- 1, 2</h4>
        <img src="pattern1.png" alt="" class="bg-light w-50 d-block mx-auto">

        <p>This is pretty simple exercise. Set your pace in metronome (initially 20/30 bpm is recommended for beginner). Try to stroke each and every time with metronome speed. Start from 6th string 1st fret followed by 2nd fret, then 5th string 1st fret with index finger followed by 2nd fret with middle finger and follow this pattern up to 1st string. Then reverse the cycle. That means 1st string 2nd fret followed by 1st fret then again same pattern up to 6th string. Remember one thing every time follow up and down method, I mean if one stroke is down then very next stroke should be up and repeat this cycle. So your first two finger index and middle fingers will be trained through this exercise.</p>
        <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

        <h4>Exercise 2: Pattern- 1, 2, 3 </h4>
        <img src="pattern2.png" alt="" class="bg-light w-50 d-block mx-auto">
        <p>This is the similar exercise as first exercise. You have to add ring finger in this exercise with index and middle finger to reach 3rd fret. So you will start from above 6th string down to 1st string and your pattern will be index finger on first fret then middle finger on 2nd fret and followed by ring finger on 3rd fret. You will start with down stroke and then up stroke should continue rhythm. After completing the cycle you will reverse the pattern that means 3 2 1, 3 2 1….3 2 1. By the way always keep a metronome when exercise.</p>
        <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

        <h4>Exercise 3: Pattern- 1, 2, 3, 4</h4>
        <img src="pattern3.png" alt="" class="bg-light w-50 d-block mx-auto">
        <p>This is the similar exercise as previous exercises. You have to add your pinky finger in this exercise with index, middle and ring finger to reach 4th fret. So you will start from above 6th string down to 1st string and your pattern will be index finger on first fret then middle finger on 2nd fret, then ring finger on 3rd fret and followed by pinky finger on 4th fret. You will start with down stroke and then up stroke should continue rhythm. After completing the cycle you will reverse the pattern that means 4 3 2 1, 4 3 2 1… 4 3 2 1. By the way always keep a metronome when exercise.</p>
        <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

        <h4>Exercise 4: Pattern- 1 3> 2 4</h4>
        <img src="pattern4.png" alt="" class="bg-light w-50 d-block mx-auto">
        <p>This exercise may seem quite difficult to you but if you had practice previous exercise perfectly then you’re ready to play this new pattern. This is little bit complicated because you have to skip one fret each time. That means if you are on 6th string then you are going to play 1st fret and 3rd fret. Here you have skipped 2nd and 4th fret. And now when you will play 5th string you should play 2nd string and 4th string, so here you have to skip 1st and 3rd fret. Also In this exercise you have to follow metronome and up and down stroke pattern. And after completion of the cycle when you reach last note on 1st string you have to reverse the cycle from 1st string to 6th string.</p>
        <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

        <h4>Exercise 5: Pattern- 2 4> 1 3</h4>
        <img src="pattern5.png" alt="" class="bg-light w-50 d-block mx-auto">
        <p>This exercise is similar to exercise number 4. The pattern is same just you have to start from 2nd fret. So in 6th string you have to play down stroke on 2nd fret and up strong on 4th fret. Then you would go to 5th string and play 1st fret and 3rd fret and this pattern will continue down to the 1st string. Then just reverse the pattern. That’s it.</p>

        <h5>Behind every brilliant performance there is a story. Hard work will make you strong and confident. Exercises are the root of guitar playing. If you want a good control over fretboard then you have to work hard to make your fingers stronger and flexible. These exercises will help you to make your fingers flexible and this will helps you a lot when playing tab or shifting chord. Don’t think too much just focus on your goal and works hard. As for now just follow these exercises and once you feel comfortable with these exercises then go to next lesson.</h5>
