            <h1>Why I select them as beginner level guitar chord?</h1>
            <p>These guitar chords are not only easy to learn but also these are the basic chords every guitar player
                should learn. These guitar chords are simultaneously using in most of the songs. If you are a beginner
                then don’t miss this discussion because I tried to make the list as a sequence of relatively easy to
                hard. I don’t want to puzzle you and I wish it could be easy and understandable for you. Okay let’s jump
                on it. </p>
            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

            <h1>E minor</h1>
            <img src="Em.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>This is the simplest guitar chord I think. And it’s very much suitable for you to learn even if you are
                an absolute beginner. All you have to do just place two finger on fret board and these are one finger on
                2nd fret 4th string and another finger on 5th string and same fret. Isn’t it super easy!!! </p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

            <h1>E major</h1>
            <img src="E.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>Let’s introduce another easy chord to you. Once you are comfortable with E minor chord then it will be
                easy to hold this E major chord. You just have to add one extra finger with previous E minor chord. So
                final position is that one finger is on 3rd string 1st fret, one on 4th string 2nd fret and last finger
                on 5th string 3rd fret. Hope this chord seems easy to you. If not then don’t be panic after practicing
                couple of time it should be easier to you.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">

            <h1>E7</h1>
            <img src="E7.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>You know how to hold E major chord!!! Then just put off your finger from 4th string and that it. So
                finger position is one finger on 3rd string 1st fret and 5th string 2nd fret.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>A major</h1>
            <img src="A.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>A major is one of the basic and most used chords while playing song. But fortunately it’s not that much
                of hard in fact it’s pretty easier to hold. What you have to do is just put your three fingers on 2nd,
                3rd and 4th string and on same 2nd fret. You may find little bit difficulty to use your all three finger
                without buzzing but don’t worry you will do it over the time. </p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>A minor</h1>
            <img src="Am.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>This A minor chord is similar with the chord E major in shape. Just step down one string from your
                holding of E major chord. So your finger position of A minor is one finger on 2nd string 1st fret and
                other finger is on 2nd fret of 3rd & 4th string.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>A7</h1>
            <img src="A7.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>It’s pretty simple to hold A7 guitar chord. You just need two finger one finger on 2nd and 4th string of
                3nd fret. Is it similar to A major chord!!!! One different is that middle finger is missing.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>D major</h1>
            <img src="D.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>D major is easy to hold but it’s quite tricky to hold and play. Great thing is that it sounds sweet. You
                have to put one finger on 3rd string 2nd fret, one finger on 1st string 2nd fret and last finger on 2nd
                string 3rd fret. Seems tricky right!!! Another tricky thing is that you shouldn’t strum upper two
                strings especially the upper one. Hope you will do it in couple of day.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>G major</h1>
            <img src="G.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>G major is one of the basic chords every guitar player may know. You need 3-4 fingers to play G major
                chord. I said 3 or 4 because you can skip holding 2nd string. Before playing G major chord on guitar for
                the first time, you need to do some finger stretching exercises even this is not going to be that much
                of hard. Your finger position is index finger on 3rd fret 6th string, middle finger on 2nd fret 5th
                string and lastly pinky finger on 3rd fret 1st string. Oh you can add another finger on 3rd fret 2nd
                string also.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>D minor</h1>
            <img src="Dm.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>D minor is also tricky as D major to play because when strumming this chord again you have to skip upper
                two strings. Finger position is one finger on 1st fret 1st string, one finger on 2nd fret 3rd string and
                last finger on 3rd fret 2nd string. You have to stretch your finger little bit.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>C major</h1>
            <img src="C.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>Hey it’s little bit harder to stretch your finger as a beginner. And it is important for you to have
                flexible finger for holding C major chord on guitar fret. So you have to do some exercise to use to with
                finger stretching for holding C major guitar chord. Finger position is one finger on 2nd string 1st
                fret, one finger on 4th string 2nd fret and last finger on 5th string 2nd fret as well.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>D7</h1>
            <img src="D7.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>This is another easy chord. Put your finger on 2nd fret 1st string, one finger on 1st fret 2nd string and
                last finger on 2nd fret 3rd string. Now strum your guitar without touching upper two strings. That’s it.
            </p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">


            <h1>C7</h1>
            <img src="C7.png" class="bg-light w-50 mx-auto d-block" alt="">
            <p>This is the toughest chord to play in this list. So you have to spend little bit more time with this
                chord. Don’t worry I’m here to explain you to make this easier to you. Place your finger in C major
                position. Now press 3rd string on 3rd fret with your pinky finger. That’s it!!! Follow the above picture
                to hold perfectly.</p>

            <hr class="bg-light border-5 border-top border-light">
